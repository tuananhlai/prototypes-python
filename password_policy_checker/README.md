python3 password_policy_checker.py hi
❌ Has 8 or more characters
```

### 3. Rule 2 — Lower-case

Print whether the password contains at least one lower-case letter.

**Sample output**

```
python3 password_policy_checker.py helloworld
✅ Has 8 or more characters

❌ Contains lower-case characters
```

### 4. Rule 3 — Upper-case

Print whether the password contains at least one upper-case letter.

**Sample output**

```
python3 password_policy_checker.py Helloworld

✅ Contains lower-case characters
✅ Contains upper-case characters

python3 password_policy_checker.py helloworld
✅ Has 8 or more characters
✅ Contains lower-case characters
❌ Contains upper-case characters
```

### 5. Rule 4 — Numeric

Print whether the password contains at least one digit.

**Sample output**

```
python3 password_policy_checker.py Helloworld1
✅ Has 8 or more characters
✅ Contains lower-case characters
✅ Contains upper-case characters
✅ Contains numeric characters

python3 password_policy_checker.py Helloworld
✅ Has 8 or more characters
✅ Contains lower-case characters
✅ Contains upper-case characters
❌ Contains numeric characters
```

### 6. Rule 5 — Special character

Print whether the password contains at least one special character (anything that is not a letter or digit).

### 7. Rule 6 — Common passwords

Print whether the password is absent from the list of 10 most common passwords.

## Hints

- You can loop over the characters of a string with `for c in p:`.
- Python sets are a good fit for checking membership in the common-password blocklist.
